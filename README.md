# Creating a minigame with Godot Engine 

This is the project shown at the Computer **Lightning Talks** (2nd Edition) in the talk named *Programando un minijuego con Godot Engine*.

The **Lightning Talks** are an initiative to share knowledge about computer science topics with college students exposing themes on short duration talks.

The purpose of this talk was to give a basic look about the things that we can do in Godot Engine, an open source game development engine that has been increasing in popularity in the last few years. In this 20 minutes long talk we live-coded a minigame in which we control a spaceship with mouse clicks and we need to avoid collissions with asteroids.
